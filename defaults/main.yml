### Define a list of mounts
##
## For better maintainability, the list is built during runtime by
## combining all lists together. This will provide the freedom of declaring
## custom group lists for granular control. The lists require a naming
## convention by using a pattern. The pattern is rendered as a single list
## which can be used for iteration with variable: 'role_mountmanager_list'
## The list name pattern needs to start with: 'role_mountmanager_list_'
##
## Types of mounts:
## - nfs
## - cifs
## - autofs

role_mountmanager_list_default: []

## Example of a list for default inheritance:
# role_mountmanager_list_default:
#   - type: nfs
#     state: mounted
#     src: 192.168.122.201:/srv/nfsexports
#     path: /srv/nfsmounts
#     fstype: nfs
#     opts: defaults,sync
#     path_owner: root
#     path_group: radix
#     path_mode: '0770'
#   - type: cifs
#     state: mounted
#     src: //192.168.122.201/smbexports
#     path: /srv/smbmounts
#     fstype: cifs
#     opts: defaults,noperm,credentials=/root/creds.txt
#     path_owner: root
#     path_group: root
#     path_mode: '0775'
#   - type: autofs
#     state: present
#     path: /srv/autofs
#     path_owner: root
#     path_group: root
#     path_mode: '0755'
#     master_file: /etc/auto.master.d/autofsexports.autofs
#     master_file_owner: root
#     master_file_group: root
#     master_file_mode: '0640'
#     master_params:
#       - /srv/autofs /etc/auto.autofsexports
#     map_file: /etc/auto.autofsexports
#     map_file_owner: root
#     map_file_group: root
#     map_file_mode: '0640'
#     map_params:
#       - autofsexports -fstype=nfs,rw,soft,intr 192.168.122.201:/srv/autofsexports
#       - autofsexports2 -fstype=nfs,rw,soft,intr 192.168.122.201:/srv/autofsexports2
